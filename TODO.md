# Hexfire TODO List

Queue:

need sounds for fire breathe and purify

test when new fire types are first introduced to make sure 1% chance is enough of a starting value 
-- do this when the spread mode is none (fixed) in settings to see actually how many of them spawn

take a look at how FIRE_TYPE_SPREAD_PROGRESSION is implemented, and test to make sure it works when 'both' is set

Future Ideas:

more shop items
-- mystery bundle containing a handful of random small rewards
-- mystery bundle that is more of a gamble, potentially containing nothing with a small chance of containing a strong item

Towers
1) Mobile unit. Jet tower with only 1 hex of range. Power is upgradable. Can be moved at any time mid-wave
2) Fire truck. Pathfinds towards burning fires and slowly moves towards the nearest one until it's extinguished, then pathfinds to the next, etc.
3) Sentry tower. auto rotates if it detects fires in range. not aeo, only hits one fire at a time. starts at range 1 and can upgrade both range and power. targets strongest fire in range.

map "zones" where spread and spawn chances are different, and fire hp and tower effectiveness are also different (later maps should have this)
